## 📡 Communication Channels & Governance

The project utilizes a dual communication structure to balance agility with rigorous technical documentation.

### Communication Matrix

| Platform | Primary Function | Content Type |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Slack** | **Synchronous Coordination** | Active discussion, *brainstorming*, status updates, immediate alerts. |
| **GitHub** | **Asynchronous Record** | Technical specifications, bug reports, RFCs (Request for Comments), permanent documentation. |

### "Source of Truth" Policy
To guarantee project integrity and external indexability:
1.  **Slack is not documentation.** Agreements made in chat must be transferred to an *Issue* or *Pull Request* to be considered official.
2.  **Transparency.** We strongly encourage the use of public channels over Direct Messages (DMs) to foster knowledge transfer within the community.
